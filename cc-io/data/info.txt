**realities:united** is a Berlin-based studio working in the contact area between art, architecture and digital technologies since 1997. 
Founded by the brothers Jan and Tim Edler the studio has gained international recognition both for the realization as well as the 
initialization of art- and hybrid art installations at an architectural and urban scale. Pieces by the brothers are both included in 
permanent museum collections like the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York, the Venice Biannual, the MOCA Museum of Contemporary 
Art in Taipei or the Vitra Design Museum in Weil am Rhein as well as in private collections like the “Schuermann Collection” -one of 
the most important private collection of “young art” in Germany. 

**LIGHT SPELL** consists of 62 light segments, all of which can produce each letter of the alphabet, as well as special characters and 
numerals from 0 to 9.  The segments can display text messages created by the passengers waiting for their train using the designated 
interface on the platform inside the station.

LightSpell is an experiment in public interaction and will entail various aspects of the theme of the freedom of the individual versus 
the interest of the larger group. Whatever individual message is projected, the installation will also deliver the necessary lighting 
for the entire station. It is a democratic installation: Everyone can overwrite, correct, or answer the existing messages. Messages 
might be erased after 10 seconds or last weeks. Light and information, aesthetic and meaning, merge into one.
